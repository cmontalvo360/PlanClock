To run the program you go to the "Main" class and start it from there. When started the first page will be the login page.
After you login you will be able to view all the appointments and customers.

The additional report I ran was to count the total number of appointments scheduled and total number of customers in the database.

This is the add appointment screen where appointments can be added if the fields meet certain requirements. The Edit Screen is the exact same except it's populated with data of the appointment you selected.
